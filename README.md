# How to get editor up and running
1. Install eclipse (choose modeling tools version during install)
2. Open the existing project located in CodeFrame
3. In the menu, choose Run-> run configurations...
4. Create a new eclipse application, change name if you want, then press Run.
5. Now the DSL editor starts (I get a warning and a null pointer exception, seems to work anyway)
6. Skip this! (Add the file association for *.TurtleBotMissionDSL in window->preferences->general->editor->file associations)
7. Open the project located in MyTurtle
8. Chose one of the example files and press the Turtle icon in the menu bar, you should now have a generated_mission.py in the project!


# Run editor
After initial setup you only need to:
1. Open the existing project located in CodeFrame
2. Run->run history->you_config_name
3. And we are done, editor up and running (should remember you last project)
